## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies

SAAS(Software as a service) - Utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users.

PAAS(Platform as a service) - Provides cloud components to software while being used mainly for applications.

IAAS(Infrastructure as a service) - Fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services.
